IS 120 Homework 5

Q. Where you used margin and why?
A. In my css box-bar class I put in a negative margin to get the images closer together. However, I haven't figured out yet how to make the cool line of images like the apple watches on the apple page. As of right now it is forcing the images to go onto a new line if there is not enough space...which doesn't look nearly as good when my website is full screened.
It feels too forced for my specific screen.
I also added a margin of 50 px between my main three cards which I like the spacing in full or small screen. It feels like a good balance of distance.


Q. Where you used padding and why?
A.  I used 0 px for padding on my cards because if I added even 1 px it made the card not flush with the border of the card. The main drawback for this is sometimes it makes the text too close to the border.


Q. Where you used display and why?
A. The card class required the inline-block so that they were on the same line, otherwise they were all under each other as if the screen's width was smaller even while it was at full screen.


Q. Where you used position and why?
A. In order to get my location badge to work correctly the card class needed to have a position of relative so that the badge could be a fixed position into the top right corner and be hanging off of the card.


Q. Where did you add a unique style?
A. I added the class of a card wrapper so that I could have the cards all centered and position at the top of the line they were displayed on so that they didn't align with each of the other cards on the bottom of the line.
