IS 120 Homework 4

Updating the website created in a previous homework!

My 3 additional properties:

I used the cursor css styling to add the pointer finger over the add to cart button,
as well as changing the cursor to be a "cell" option while it hovers over the table so
that it has more of an excel feel to it. 

I thought about adding the wait cursor (which shows the loading circle)
on my website a tags, but thought that that would be rude.

I know you suggested to avoid using margin as one of the 3 css options, but I really wanted
my text to be centered and left aligned and that seemed like the best option so far.

The toggle feature combined with hue-rotate is the 3rd new css implemented, and it is able to go back and
forth between the different hues, the original hue and the 180 degree inverted hue.
